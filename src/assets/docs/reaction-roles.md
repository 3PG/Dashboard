# Reaction Roles

---

## Reaction Roles `[]`
React to messages, to get roles.

### How does it work?
When a user reacts to a message they get a role.
When they remove the reaction, they lose assigned role.

---

### Channel `''`
The channel containing the reaction role message.
This is used for getting the message within the channel.

### Emote `''`
The emote itself used for the reaction message.
For example, if `ðŸ¤”` was the emote, then `ðŸ¤”` will give the assigned role.

### Message ID `''`
The ID of the reaction role message.
This is used for identifying the message, and all reaction role operations.

### Role `''`
The role given after reacting to the reaction role message.
