        <h1>Welcome to the Alpha Dashboard!</h1>
        <p>This is a pre-release of an upcoming 3PG update (<a href="/docs/alpha">More info</a>).<br>
        <a href="/docs/badges">Special rewards</a> will be given to those who help report bugs.</p>
        There are some bugs as this is an early release, and not all features have been fully manually tested.

        <p>Hopefully this dashboard gives you a much better experience than the last version.</p>
