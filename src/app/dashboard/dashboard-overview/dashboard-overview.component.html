        <p>
            This is a pre-release of an upcoming 3PG update (<a href="/docs/alpha">More info</a>).<br>
            <a href="/docs/badges">Special rewards</a> will be given to those who help report bugs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are some bugs as this is an early release, and not all features have been fully manually tested.<br>
            Hopefully this dashboard gives you a much better experience than the last version.
        </p>
